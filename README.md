# CSI Proxy

> There's a [KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3636) about moving CSI Drivers to HostProcess containers which involves making CSI Proxy a Go library, development for this work is happening in the `library-development` branch

CSI Proxy (which might be more aptly named "csi-node-proxy") is a binary that exposes a set of gRPC APIs (over named pipes) around local storage operations for nodes in Windows. A container, such as CSI node plugins, can mount the named pipes depending on operations it wants to exercise on the host and
invoke the APIs.  This allows a storage plugin to run as if were a CSI plugin on linux which have the ability to perform "privileged" actions on the windows host OS.

![CSI Proxy High Level Architecture Diagram](./docs/csi-proxy-high-level-arch.png)

In the above diagram, there are 3 communication channels being utilized for CSI proxy:

- `csi.sock` : This usually lives at c:/var/lib/kubelet/plugins/csi-plugin/csi.sock, and is used for the host OS to communicate with the CSI node plugin
- `csi-plugin-reg.sock` : This lives here, c:/var/lib/kubelet/plugins_registry/csi-plugin-reg.sock, and is used for the kubelet itself to get metadata as needed from the csi plugin .
- `\\.\pipe\csi-proxy` : This will live in a pipe, i.e. at \\.\pipe/csi-proxy-api-group-v-... : upon receipt of specific requests from the Node plugin, it carries out actions on the node plugins behalf.  Since it doesn't execute arbitrary commands on the host, its more secure then simply being a black-box proxy to run host commands.

Each named pipe will support a specific version of an API (e.g. v1alpha1, v1beta1, v1beta2, v1)
that targets a specific area of storage (e.g. disk, volume, file, SMB, iSCSI).

## Overview

CSI drivers are recommended to be deployed as containers. Node plugin containers need to run with privileges to perform storage related operations. However, Windows does not support privileged containers currently. With CSIProxy, the node plugins can now be deployed as unprivileged pods that use the proxy to perform privileged storage operations on the node. Kubernetes administrators will need to install and maintain csi-proxy.exe on all Windows nodes in a manner similar to kubelet.exe.

## Compatibility

Recommended K8s Version: 1.18

## Feature status

CSI Proxy is in a stable status ([GA Blogpost](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/08/09/csi-windows-support-with-csi-proxy-reaches-ga/)), the latest versions of the API Groups are:

| API Group  | Latest Version | API Docs                                                |
| ---        | ---            | ---                                                     |
| Disk       | v1             | [link](./docs/apis/disk_v1.md)                          |
| Filesystem | v1             | [link](./docs/apis/filesystem_v1.md)                    |
| SMB        | v1             | [link](./docs/apis/smb_v1.md)                           |
| Volume     | v1             | [link](./docs/apis/volume_v1.md)                        |
| iSCSI      | v1alpha2       | [link to proto](./client/api/iscsi/v1alpha2/api.proto)  |
| System     | v1alpha1       | [link to proto](./client/api/system/v1alpha1/api.proto) |

## Build

`csi-proxy.exe` binary has not published yet. You need to clone the repo and build it. The easiest way to build this binary is using the makefile in this repo.

```
   git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-proxy
   sudo make build
```

On successful execution of `make build`, the output binary `csi-proxy.exe` will be available under `/bin` directory.

## Installation

csi-proxy.exe can be installed and run as binary or run as a Windows service on each Windows node. See the following as an example to run CSI Proxy as a web service.
```
    $flags = "-windows-service -log_file=C:\etc\kubernetes\logs\csi-proxy.log -logtostderr=false"
    sc.exe create csiproxy start= "auto" binPath= "C:\etc\kubernetes\node\bin\csi-proxy.exe $flags"
    sc.exe failure csiproxy reset= 0 actions= restart/10000
    sc.exe start csiproxy
```
If you are using kube-up to start a Windows cluster, node startup script will automatically run csi-proxy as a service. For GKE 1.18+, csi-proxy will be installed automatically.

## Usage

### Command line options

* `--kubelet-path`: This is the prefix path of the kubelet path directory in the host file system (`C:\var\lib\kubelet` is used by default).
* `--working-dir` (repeated flag): Prefix path where CSI Proxy is allowed to make privileged operations in the host file system (no value by default).

### Setup for CSI Driver Deployment

Deploy and start csiproxy.exe on all Windows hosts in the cluster. Next, the named
pipes can be mounted in a CSI node plugin DaemonSet YAML in the following manner:

```
kind: DaemonSet
apiVersion: apps/v1

  name: csi-storage-node-win
